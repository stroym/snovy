# snovy

Powerful note manager in the making; future part of the wider snovald worldbuilding tool.

You can give it a test run [here](https://stroym.github.io/snovy/). Fair warning: it‘s very much WIP and full of dev only things. :)

As it‘s still very much in heavy development with some core features missing, currently there‘s no version released and the repo itself is not as set up as it could be, either.

# Motivation

There are many note managers, so why create yet another one? That's quite simple: none of the ones I've personally used
allow for any meaningful filtering, especially when you throw tags into the mix. To add to that, some are bloated with
features, others are too feature poor, but for the most part they all don't really look all that great. :)

It is entirely possible the amount of filtering possibilities planned for snovy are over the top, but I hope that even
if I personally won‘t end up using them, someone will. Regardless, this is not the only goal of this project. The others
are to deepen my knowledge of front-end development (and specifically React) and to build up a decent library of custom
components to use in future projects.

# Feature overview/roadmap

- Offline-first approach (for the time being offline only!).
- UI customization/layout flexibility (theming, resizable and collapsible portions).
- In-line markdown editor (currently handled by the [outline editor](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor), but that is very much subject to change).
- Export/Import to file and possibly directly to some prominent cloud providers, possibly even git repos.
- Note states.
- Note tags and tag scopes, including unique scoped tags (only one per scope per note).
- Note resources (images and such).
- Favorites.
- Archive (and most likely eventually a trash can to allow for recovery of mistakenly deleted notes/sections/notebooks).
- And who knows what else. :)
